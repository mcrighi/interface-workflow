# Input file for a shear strength AiiDA workflow.
# Every line in the upper section has to be set although the order does not matter.
# If a line in the upper section is missing, the workflow will exit with a warning.
# The lower section can also be changed but should be OK for most tasks. If it is not set, defaults will be used.
